The more legible and instructive HTML-version of the FAQ file is
available as
 http://www.netikka.net/tsneti/info/tscmd.htm
However, the tscmd.zip contains a number separate script files which
are not part of the HTML-version.
   The following changes have been made in this version. Besides
editing many of the already existing items added the FAQ item (which
is available also in the HTML-version)
 169} How to set the time server from cmd and how to synchronize the clock?
Added a new script to the zipped package
 GETFDATE.CMD Get a file's date/time stamp
Updated the following scripts
 FILEINFO.CMD Information about a file
 NAMEDOWN.CMD Covert a filename to lower case
 NAMEUP.CMD   Covert a filename to upper case
If the target file name contained an ampersand (&), which is a special
character in command-line scripting, the said scripts broke. Now they
exit cleanly with an appropriate warning message about the situation.
The script
 FULLNAME.CMD Display the full name of a file
can now handle ampersands. Also some minor changes in a few of the
other scripts.

Thu 21-Aug-2008: Now that the HTML-version of my NT/2000/XP/..
script FAQ is ready at
 http://www.netikka.net/tsneti/info/tscmd.htm
I have made a corresponding update of the zipped file version

In tscmd48e added:
 167} How do I find out who is logged on the system?
In tscmd48f added:

Thu 6-Mar-2008: I am gradually building up the web alternative of
the FAQ section 1CMDFAQ.TXT of this collection at
 http://www.netikka.net/tsneti/info/tscmd.htm
Consequently there are updates of the information reflected in the
following succession

 tscmd47.zip Useful NT/2000/XP script tricks and tips, T.Salmi
I have started an HTML-version of the collection 1CMDFAQ.TXT file.
That is the main FAQ text file. Only a part of the items have been
converted yet. Nor are the HTML-pages meant to replace the tscmd.zip
collection. Rather as an optional reference utilizing the visual
flexibility of HTML presentation.The address of the HTML-version is
 http://www.netikka.net/tsneti/info/tscmd.htm
Even if there are no new items, as a consequence of the html-version
I have done much even complete rewriting on a number of the FAQ
items. Some of it even crucial. E.g. better to handle long file
names and on occasion the poison characters, and much much more.
Hence the release of this intermediate version.

Thu 6-Mar-2008: A minor update
 209940 Mar 6 2008 ftp://garbo.uwasa.fi/pc/link/tscmd.zip
 tscmd46a.zip Useful NT/2000/XP script tricks and tips, T.Salmi
Added more information to "10) How can I change the environment
variable values within a FOR loop?"
 Renamed the earlier item "40) How do I get the number of arguments
given to a script?" to a more generic "How to get the number of and
parse the arguments given to a script?" with added tricks.
 Added a new example to the item "80) How can I extract the last part
of a path such as C:\ABC\DEF\GHI\?"

Sat 23-Feb-2008: Released the update
 207709 Feb 23 2008 ftp://garbo.uwasa.fi/pc/link/tscmd.zip
 tscmd46.zip Useful NT/2000/XP script tricks and tips, T.Salmi
Added to the collection the new scripts
  "QP2DOS.CMD   Convert quoted printable encoded file to DOS"
  "MAKEPASS.CMD Make a randomized password"
 Updated
  "EDATE.CMD to display some alternative date formats"
to display some more date formats by adding switches
 /C1 = DD.MMM.YYYY HH:mm:ss
 /C2 = Wkd DD-MMM-YYYY HH:mm
 /C3 = YYMMDD
 /C4 = YYYYMMDD
It also sends the new result to the clipboard if a clipboard utility
is available. For that, get CLIP.EXE from the publicly available
Windows 98 Resource Kit or copy a more recent version from Windows
Server 2003's C:\%windir%\system32 folder.
  Linkrot is inevitable. Updated a number of reference links in the
1CMDFAQ.TXT FAQ file.

Sun 23-Dec-2007: After the many rounds of the FAQ collection the
updates naturally come farther apart. The previous update was in
May 2007. The new update now is
 202569 Dec 23 2007 ftp://garbo.uwasa.fi/pc/link/tscmd.zip
 tscmd45.zip Useful NT/2000/XP script tricks and tips, T.Salmi
It includes the following new items in the main FAQ file 1CMDFAQ.TXT
 161} How do I test that the Windows Script Host is available?
 162} Finding duplicate files in a directory tree
plus some additions and corrections here and there.
   I have also updated many of the script files included in the
collection. Mainly, I have added a lockfile test to prevent running
duplicate copies of some of the slower scripts which use auxiliary,
temporary files for their tasks. I have also added some tests to
ensure that the path to the %TEMP% folder is present. And some
other, minor changes. Unless there are problems, these exotic
adjustments should be invisible to the user in running the scripts.
Furthermore, rewrote e.g. the following batch to give much more
information
 "FULLNAME.CMD Display the full name of a file"

Thu 17-May-2007: I have made an update

 51} How can I echo lines in different colors in NT scripts?

Fri 16-Feb-2007: After releasing the version tscmd43.zip it came up
in alt.msdos.batch.nt that some users may use or have to use long
file names for their TEMP and TMP variables. This was news to me.
Although this might just be a rare exception I have browsed through
the FAQ for such eventualities and tried to make the FAQ items and
the included scripts more universal in that respect. Hence a quick
followup release

   Added two auxiliary Turbo Pascal program executables to help in
complicated date calculations. The code is based on what I have in
my separate Turbo Pascal FAQ tsfaqp.zip, item #119. It is true that
these conversions can, and have been programmed in straight script
by others. I did not wish duplicate that work. Even more
importantly, a compiled program is fast if there is, say hundreds of
file datetime stamps to browse in some task.
 DATE2NUM.EXE Date into a Julian date number
 NUM2DATE.EXE A Julian date number into a date
Added the items
 31} How many days ago was 31.12.2003? What date it was a 100 days ago?

 33} How can I convert a binary, octal, hexadecimal into a decimal?
The item
  "14} Help! My old batch files won't work since there is no choice"

over SET /P is that the former can handle timed default input. The
CHOOSE.EXE program was included in the package.

   Changed the name of the companion WHERE.CMD "Find a file anywhere
